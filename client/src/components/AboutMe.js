        Hi my name is Emily Wirtz! I am from Kansas City, Missouri. I have a
        B.A. in Spanish and Hispanic Studies, with a minor in Business
        Administration from Creighton University.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a Fullstack Software Engineer based in Kansas City, but open to
        relocating. I enjoy problem solving and critical thinking, and learning
        to code has been an enormous exercise in using both to piece a new
        language together. I love that there will always be somethng new to
        learn, and different ways to make existing languages do innovative
        things.
      </p>

        Before I started my journey into coding, I worked my way through the
        food service industry. Hosting, serving, and ultimately managing gave me
        the skills to interact with all sorts of people, prioritize and
        re-prioritize many moving parts at once, and take responsibility for my
        work. Another significant work experience was tackling Operations at a
        fine jewelry e-commerce company in San Francisco. There, I worked my way
        up from associate to manager, learning the ins and outs of shipping and
        receiving and operations as a whole. Aside from maintaining the ability
        to keep up with the rapidly rising volume, it was a pleasure to be able
        to work through operational issues and ideas overall and with our
        NetSuite team, creatively solving problems and brainstorming company
        goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experiences have allowed me to travel quite a bit, having lived in
        Omaha, San Francisco, and Costa Rica. I also spent a month completing a
        500-mile pilgrimage across Spain known as the Camino de Santiago. Now, I
        am about to complete a Fullstack Coding Boot Camp through the University
        of Kansas, and I can't wait to see where coding will take me next.
